# Progress: Junior Researcher

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Command-line interface with argument parsing
- ✅ Query analysis for determining research parameters
- ✅ Follow-up question generation and processing
- ✅ Multi-layered research with different modes (fast, balanced, comprehensive)
- ✅ Concurrent processing of multiple research queries
- ✅ Progress tracking and visualization
- ✅ Report generation with citations
- ✅ Source tracking and citation management

### Research Modes
- ✅ Fast Mode: Quick, surface-level research
- ✅ Balanced Mode: Moderate depth and breadth
- ✅ Comprehensive Mode: Exhaustive, in-depth research with recursive deep diving

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ Integration with Google's Gemini API
- ✅ Asynchronous processing using asyncio
- ✅ Tree-based research structure for hierarchical queries
- ✅ Semantic similarity checking for query diversity
- ✅ Environment variable management with dotenv

### UI Implementation
- ✅ Rebranding to "Junior Researcher" with centered, clean design
- ✅ Bluish color scheme implementation that's easy on the eyes
- ✅ Enhanced typography for research results with markdown rendering
- ✅ Special handling for citations in research results
- ✅ Three-state research flow (initial query → followup questions → results)
- ✅ Improved research mode display with detailed information
- ✅ Dynamic adjustment of parameters based on selected mode
- ✅ Responsive grid layout system
- ✅ Enhanced component styling with Tailwind and Shadcn UI
- ✅ Proper error handling and loading states in the UI

## What's Left to Build

### Testing
- ❌ Unit tests for core components
- ❌ Integration tests for API interactions
- ❌ End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- ❌ Performance benchmarks

### Documentation
- ❌ Comprehensive API documentation
- ❌ Detailed user guide and developer documentation
- ❌ Example use cases and tutorials

### Features
- ✅ Enhanced web-based user interface improvements with a clean and minimal design
- ❌ Dark mode toggle for the UI
- ❌ Research history persistence
- ❌ Additional output formats
- ❌ Advanced visualization of research trees
- ❌ User authentication and multi-user support
- ❌ API service for integration with other applications

### Improvements
- ❌ Enhanced error handling and logging
- ❌ API usage optimization
- ❌ Performance optimizations
- ❌ More fine-grained control over research parameters

## Current Status

The application is functional with all core features implemented. It now supports both CLI and web-based research modalities with a significantly improved UI.

### Development Phase
- **Initial Development**: Complete
- **UI Enhancement**: Complete
- **Testing**: Not Started
- **Documentation**: Not Started
- **Optimization**: Not Started
- **Feature Expansion**: Not Started

### Deployment Status
- **Local Development**: FastAPI backend is served via uvicorn and the web UI is integrated using Next.js.
- **Docker Containerization**: Removed – backend is deployed directly via uvicorn.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Not Implemented
- **Production Deployment**: Not Implemented

## Known Issues

- API rate limits and token constraints may affect performance.
- Memory usage may rise for complex research topics.
- User error messaging and logging need further refinement.

## Next Milestones
