# Product Context: Junior Researcher

## Purpose & Vision

Junior Researcher (formerly Open Gemini Deep Research) exists to democratize access to comprehensive research capabilities by leveraging AI technology. Originally designed as a command‐line research assistant, the project has evolved to integrate a modern web‐based user interface built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS. This upgrade significantly improves accessibility, interactivity, and user experience while maintaining robust research capabilities.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Research Inefficiency
Traditional research is time‐consuming and labor‐intensive. Junior Researcher automates the process of gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information, reducing research time from hours or days to minutes.

### 2. Depth Limitations
Human researchers are limited by time when exploring complex topics. This tool enables recursive deep diving into a subject, providing exhaustive exploration.

### 3. Breadth Constraints
By processing multiple unique queries concurrently, the application ensures comprehensive coverage of diverse aspects of a topic.

### 4. Citation Management
Automated tracking of sources and generation of properly formatted citations streamline the research process and enhance credibility. The improved UI now displays citations clearly and elegantly.

### 5. Research Synthesis
The tool aggregates findings from multiple sources into a coherent, well-structured final report with proper formatting and typography.

## User Experience Goals

- **Simplicity**: Users can initiate complex research with a single query in a clean, minimal UI.
- **Transparency**: Clear progress tracking and visualization of the research process.
- **Flexibility**: Customizable parameters for depth, breadth, and mode to suit different research needs, presented in an intuitive manner.
- **Quality**: Comprehensive, accurate reports with proper citations, displayed elegantly.
- **Efficiency**: Rapid research processing that significantly outpaces manual methods.

## Target Users

- **Academic Researchers**
- **Business Professionals**
- **Content Creators**
- **Curious Individuals**

## User Workflows

### Basic Research Workflow
1. User submits a research query.
2. The application analyzes the query to determine optimal research parameters.
3. Follow-up questions are generated automatically for further clarification.
4. Multi-layered research is performed.
5. A comprehensive report with citations is generated and delivered to the user.

### Advanced Research Workflow
1. User provides a specialized query with custom parameters.
2. Customized research is conducted based on these parameters.
3. Learnings are used to refine subsequent queries.
4. A tailor-made report is generated.

## Success Metrics

- **Research Quality**: Accuracy, depth, and relevance of the generated reports.
- **Time Efficiency**: Drastically reduced research completion times compared to manual research.
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive user feedback on the simplicity and usefulness of the research outputs.
- **Adoption Rate**: Increased usage frequency and number of users.
- **Report Depth**: Measured by the level of detail, number of sources, and richness of citations.
